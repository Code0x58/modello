[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Code0x58/modello.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Code0x58/modello)

## Examples
Under the `./examples/` directory are modules with use case examples along with doctest and pytest tests to make sure they work and don't fall behind.

## Development
Run the tests and linting with `python setup.py test`.

## TODO:
 * elaborate on tests/examples
 * build wheel and source distrobutions and publish
 * work out patterns for labels/names on symbols so they render nicely
 * for mypy, consider getting value from or removing it
